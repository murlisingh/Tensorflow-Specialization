**My Certification** : 

## Course 1: Introduction to TensorFlow for AI, ML and DL

This first course introduces you to Tensor Flow, a popular machine learning framework. You will learn how to build a basic neural network for computer vision and use convolutions to improve your neural network.

#### Week 1: A New Programming Paradigm

#### Week 2: Introduction to Computer Vision

#### Week 3: Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks

#### Week 4: Using Real-World Images

## Course 2: Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow

This second course teaches you advanced techniques to improve the computer vision model you built in Course 1. You will explore how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropouts. Finally, Course 2 will introduce you to transfer learning and how learned features can be extracted from models.

#### Week 1: Exploring a Larger Dataset

#### Week 2: Augmentation, a Technique to Avoid Overfitting

#### Week 3: Transfer Learning

#### Week 4: Multi-class Classifications

## Course 3: Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow

In this third course, you’ll learn how to apply neural networks to solve natural language processing problems using TensorFlow. You’ll learn how to process and represent text through tokenization so that it’s recognizable by a neural network. You’ll be introduced to new types of neural networks, including RNNs, GRUs and LSTMs, and how you can train them to understand the meaning of text. Finally, you’ll learn how to train LSTMs on existing text to create original poetry and more!

#### Week 1: Sentiment in Text

#### Week 2: Word Embeddings

#### Week 3: Sequence Models

#### Week 4: Sequence Models and Literature

## Course 4: Sequences, Time Series, and Prediction

In this fourth course, you will learn how to solve time series and forecasting problems in TensorFlow. You’ll first implement best practices to prepare data for time series learning. You’ll also explore how RNNs and ConvNets can be used for predictions. Finally, you’ll apply everything you’ve learned throughout the Specialization to build a sunspot prediction model using real-world data!

#### Week 1: Sequences and Prediction

#### Week 2: Deep Neural Networks for Time Series

#### Week 3: Recurrent Neural Networks for Time Series

#### Week 4: Real-world Time Series Data
